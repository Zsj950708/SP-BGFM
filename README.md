# SP-BGFM
SP-BGFM (Sparse Bayesian Group Factor Model for Feature Interactions in Multiple Count Tables Data) is a Bayesian semi-parametric model for multiple domians of next-generation sequencing microbiome abundance data. It models cross-domain interaction between microbial features directly using observed count tables, and provides a flexible DP mixture structure for interpretattion.

For more information, read the paper: Sparse Bayesian Group Factor Model for Feature Interactions in Multiple Count Tables Data (to be submitted). An presentation will be on JSM 2023, Toronto.
